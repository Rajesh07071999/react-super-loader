# 🚀 React Super Loader - Launch Guide

This guide will walk you through the complete process of launching your `react-super-loader` npm package from development to publication.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- ✅ Node.js 14+ installed
- ✅ npm account (create one at [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com))
- ✅ Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
- ✅ Code editor (VS Code recommended)

## 🛠️ Step 1: Setup Development Environment

### 1.1 Install Dependencies

```bash
# Navigate to your package directory
cd react-super-loader

# Install all dependencies
npm install
```

### 1.2 Update Package Information

Edit `package.json` and update the following fields:

```json
{
  "name": "react-super-loader",

    "name": "Rajesh Lenka",
    "email": "rajeshlenka19999@gmail.com",
    "url": "https://github.com/Rajesh07071999"
  },
  "repository": {

}
```

### 1.3 Test Your Package

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Check for linting issues
npm run lint

npm run lint

# Fix auto-fixable issues
npm run lint:fix
```

### 2.3 Test Build

```bash
# Build the package
npm run build

# Check the dist folder was created
ls -la dist/
```

You should see:
